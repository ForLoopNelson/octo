# Welcome!

If you landed here, there is a good chance you are new to Octo. This document is meant to serve as both an overview and an example of what Octo can do. In fact, this document itself is editable. Try it out!

## Beautiful, yet functional

We are committed to offering an __excellent__ writing experience on all of your devices. A great writing app gets out of your way and makes it simple to get your thoughts down as easily as possible. Markdown is a great language for writing content, _especially when there is code involved,_ but we have to render it to see what our final document looks like. Depending on the approach used, this can be a huge interruption to your writing flow.

As you can see, we take a unique approach in Octo with a hybrid markdown editor called [Ink](https://github.com/writewithocto/ink). Instead of replacing the plain-text markdown of your document, we just apply some light styles to it directly. This is especially noticeable with headers and code blocks, as you can see here.

```js
// a small example
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

## Empowering, not controlling

We take your privacy and security seriously. While we offer user accounts for additional functionality - such as document syncing, document sharing, and backing up your data - they are not required to use Octo. Unless you decide otherwise, your data never leaves the browser. Designed to be offline-first, everything Octo needs to function is now on your machine just by loading this page.

If you decide to sign up for an account, you can always take advantage of __client-side encryption__ to ensure no one sees your data but you. We use top security practices, as many apps do, but end-to-end encryption is the best way to ensure your data stays private.

Your data belongs to you, not us. We can't hold it hostage, and you can export it any time.

## Your second brain

Your brain stores information in a network of interconnected neurons. We believe information should be organized the same way.

Octo uses tags to link documents together in the format of `#some_tag`. You can add them anywhere (outside of code). Go ahead, add one to this page and see what happens in the tag list! We are working on document references and embeddable documents too, so keep an eye out for that!

Beyond tagging your docs, we also give you the power of regular expressions to search your documents any way you see fit. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful and flexible. We don't assume we know how you want to search your data, so we prefer to give you the tools you need!

## Configurability is key

A lot of tools make assumptions about how you use them. While some assumptions are unavoidable, others absolutely can and should be made configurable. In Octo, we do our best to ensure you can configure many aspects of the editor that will make your experience as enjoyable as possible.
